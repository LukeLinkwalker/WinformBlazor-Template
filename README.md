# WinformBlazor-Template

This template has been setup to use .NET 6 with Blazor such that the UI for desktop applications can be made with the tooling that you would normally use for implementing the front-end when doing web development.

The template has also been setup such that developer tools that one would have access to in the browser are available by pressing Ctrl + Shift + I when running in debug mode.

Lastly the project also contains examples of how to invoke events that are used to send information from the 'front-end' to the 'back-end' and vice versa.

Todo:
- [ ] Add script for renaming the project.
